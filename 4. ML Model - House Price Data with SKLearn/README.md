# Bangalore House Price Prediction with Linear and Ridge Regression

## Overview
This project involves predicting house prices in Bangalore using machine learning techniques. We start with basic linear regression and enhance the model using techniques like removing outliers, addressing multicollinearity, adding polynomial features, and applying ridge regression for improved performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `BangaloreHousing.csv`. It includes various features related to house properties in Bangalore, such as the area, number of bedrooms, and the presence of amenities like a gymnasium, swimming pool, etc.

## Project Structure
- **Import Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning.
- **Load Data**: Load the dataset and visualize the distribution of house prices.
- **Remove Outliers**: Identify and remove extreme outliers from the `Price` column.
- **Feature Selection and Standardization**: Select relevant features and standardize them.
- **Train-Test Split and Linear Regression**: Train and evaluate a basic linear regression model.
- **Check for Multicollinearity**: Calculate Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify multicollinearity.
- **Remove High VIF Features**: Remove features with high VIF values.
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Select top features using RFE.
- **Polynomial Features and Linear Regression**: Generate polynomial features and train a linear regression model.
- **Ridge Regression**: Train and evaluate a ridge regression model, with cross-validation for performance stability.

## Methodology

### 1. Import Libraries
Importing essential libraries for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.

### 2. Load Data
Loading the dataset from a CSV file and displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.

### 3. Visualize the Distribution of House Prices
Creating a histogram to visualize the distribution of house prices and identify potential outliers.

### 4. Remove Outliers
Removing extreme outliers from the `Price` column to ensure better model performance and then rechecking the distribution.

### 5. Feature Selection and Standardization
Selecting a subset of relevant features for the model and standardizing these features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### 6. Train-Test Split and Linear Regression
Splitting the data into training and testing sets, training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score.

### 7. Visualization for Linear Regression
Visualizing the actual vs. predicted prices and the residuals to assess the model's performance. Displaying the model coefficients and intercept.

### 8. Check for Multicollinearity
Calculating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to identify multicollinearity among features.

### 9. Remove High VIF Features
Removing features with high VIF values to reduce multicollinearity and improve the model's stability.

### 10. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
Using RFE to select the top features that contribute the most to the model's prediction.

### 11. Polynomial Features and Linear Regression
Generating polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships and training a linear regression model with these features. Evaluating the improved model's performance.

### 12. Remove Outliers from Features
Removing outliers from the selected features to further refine the model.

### 13. Ridge Regression
Applying ridge regression to address overfitting by adding a regularization term to the linear regression. Evaluating the model with cross-validation to ensure performance stability.
