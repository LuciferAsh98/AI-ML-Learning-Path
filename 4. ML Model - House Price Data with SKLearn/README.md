# ML Model - House Price Data with SKLearn

This project demonstrates a machine learning model to predict house prices in Bangalore using SKLearn. It includes data processing, feature engineering, and model training using various Python libraries.


## Files Description

1. **HouseModelPrice_Bangalore.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the step-by-step implementation of the machine learning model.
2. **app.py**: Python script for running the trained model and making predictions.
3. **bengaluru_house_prices.csv**: Dataset containing the house prices in Bangalore with various features.
4. **feature_names.pkl**: Pickle file containing the names of the features used in the model.
5. **house_price_model.pkl**: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model.
6. **unique_locations.pkl**: Pickle file containing unique locations data used for feature engineering.
